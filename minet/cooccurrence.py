    Co-occurrence Evaluation Using Fisher's Exact Test

    1. Convert the input vectors v1 and v2 into presence/absence vectors.
    2. Perform Fisher's exact test on the contingency table, which includes the number of co-occurring cases, cases occurring only in one vector, and cases where both are absent.
    3. Additionally, calculate the odds ratio of finding the number of co-occurring cases versus the expected value assuming independence.

    Returns:
        odds_ratio (float): The observed frequency divided by the expected frequency of independent cases.
        p_value (float): The p-value from Fisher's exact test.
